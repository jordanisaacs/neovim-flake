=== Changelog

https://github.com/jordanisaacs[jordanisaacs]:

* Removed hare language support (lsp/tree-sitter/etc). `vim.lsp.hare` is no longer defined. If you use hare and would like it added back, please file an issue.

* <<opt-vim.startPlugins>> & <<opt-vim.optPlugins>> are now an enum of `string` for options sourced from the flake inputs. Users can still provide vim plugin packages.
+
If you are contributing and adding a new plugin, add the plugin name to `availablePlugins` in https://github.com/jordanisaacs/neovim-flake/blob/20cec032bd74bc3d20ac17ce36cd84786a04fd3e/modules/lib/types-plugin.nix[types-plugin.nix].

* `neovimBuilder` has been removed for configuration. Using an overlay is no longer required. See the manual for the new way to configuration.

* Treesitter grammars are now configurable with <<opt-vim.treesitter.grammars>>. Utilizes the nixpkgs `nvim-treesitter` plugin rather than a custom input in order to take advantage of build support of pinned versions. See https://discourse.nixos.org/t/psa-if-you-are-on-unstable-try-out-nvim-treesitter-withallgrammars/23321?u=snowytrees[discourse] for more information. Packages can be found under the `vimPlugins.nvim-treesitter.builtGrammars` namespace.

* <<opt-vim.configRC>> and <<opt-vim.luaConfigRC>> are now of type DAG lines. This allows for ordering of the config. Usage is the same is in home-manager's `home.activation` option.
